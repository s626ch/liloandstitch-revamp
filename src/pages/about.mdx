If you really want a complete laundry list of stuff I have done, and can do...

- Web Design
- Web Development
- Software Development
- System Administration
- Network Infrastructure
- Graphic Design
- Music Production
- Video Editing
- Photo Editing
- 3D Rigging
- 3D Modeling
- ...and probably more I'm struggling to remember.

This is all stuff I've picked up just doing things as a hobby over the years.
